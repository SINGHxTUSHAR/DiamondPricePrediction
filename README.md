# Diamond Price Prediction  &#11201;

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using regression algorithms. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various features of diamonds and build a predictive model.

## Features :
The goal is to predict `price` of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including `id`):

* `id` : unique identifier of each diamond
* `carat` : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
* `cut` : Quality of Diamond Cut
* `color` : Color of Diamond
* `clarity` : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
* `depth` : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
* `table` : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
* `x` : Diamond X dimension
* `y` : Diamond Y dimension
* `x` : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:
* `price`: Price of the given Diamond.

## Requirements :

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.9)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Other dependencies (refer to the requirements.txt)

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Setup :

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SINGHxTUSHAR/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
```
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Usage :

- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Navigate to the Diamond_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook and open it.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells.
